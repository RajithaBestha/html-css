<p>The Jagannath Temple is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Jagannath, 
     a form of <b>Sri Krishna</b> in Puri in the state of <i>Odisha </i>on the eastern coast of India. 
     The present temple was rebuilt from the 10th century onwards, on the site of an earlier temple, 
     and begun by Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, the first king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.

    The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra, or chariot festival, 
    in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and <mark>elaborately </mark>decorated temple cars.
     Unlike the stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath 
     (which gave its name to the English term 'juggernaut') is made of wood and is ceremoniously 
     replaced every twelve or 19 years by an exact replica. It is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites.

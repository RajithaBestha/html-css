<p><b>The Somnath temple</b> (also known as the Deo Patan) located in Prabhas Patan in Veraval in Saurashtra
     on the western coast of Gujarat, India is believed to be the first among the twelve<mark> <small><u>Jyotirlinga</u> </small></mark>
     shrines of Lord Shiva. It is an important Hindu pilgrimage and tourist spot of India and especially
      of Gujarat. Reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by several Muslim 
      invaders and rulers, the present mandir was reconstructed in the Chaulukya style of 
      Hindu temple architecture and completed in May 1951. The reconstruction was started under the orders 
      of the first Home Minister of India Vallabhbhai Patel and completed after his death. Presently 
      the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi is the chairman of Shree Somnath Mandir trust.

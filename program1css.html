    <p class="css"> 1.The Padmanabhaswamy temple is a Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital of Kerala, India. It is considered the richest place of worship in the world</p>
    <h1>2.The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Tamil translates to "The City of Lord Ananta", (The City Of Lord Vishnu) referring to the deity of the Padmanabhaswamy temple.</h1> 
    <p id="temple">  3.The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura. While the Ananthapura
          temple at Kumbla in Kasaragod is considered the original seat of the deity ("Moolasthanam"), architecturally to some extent, 
          the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar. </p>
